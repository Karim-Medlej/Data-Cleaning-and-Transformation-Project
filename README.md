# Data cleaning and transformation

This project demonstrates how to use Excel to perform data analysis on a bike sales company. The goal is to understand the characteristics and preferences of the customers, such as their age, gender, and location. The project consists of three main steps:

  - Data cleaning: This step involves identifying and correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data set, such as missing values, duplicates, or outliers.
  - Data transformation: This step involves reshaping or reorganizing the data to make it easier to analyze, such as creating new variables, grouping data, or filtering data.
  - Dashboard creation: This step involves designing and building a dashboard that summarizes and visualizes the key findings of the data analysis, such as charts, tables, or maps.
